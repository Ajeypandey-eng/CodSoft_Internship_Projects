2.  **[Sales Prediction](./Data%20Science/Sales%20Prediction/)**: Forecasting sales revenue based on advertising spend.
3.  **[Credit Card Fraud Detection](./Data%20Science/Credit%20Card%20Problem/)**: Detecting fraudulent transactions using SMOTE and Random Forest.

## 🚀 Getting Started
Each project folder contains its own `README.md` and `requirements.txt`.
To run a specific project:
1.  Navigate to the folder (e.g., `cd Artificial Intelligence/Face Recognition`).
2.  Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3.  Run the main script (instructions in the project's README).
